# Attendance Management System 

## Overview
The Attendance Management System is a Django-based application designed to facilitate the management of attendance records for a school. It provides features for tracking attendance, managing courses, staff members, students, timetables, and feedback.

## Installation
1. Clone the project repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/omesh-barhate/DIGITRAX.git

2. Change into the project directory:
cd attendance-management-system

3. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:
python3 -m venv venv

4. Activate the virtual environment:
- For Windows:
  
  venv\Scripts\activate
  
- For macOS/Linux:
  
  source venv/bin/activate
  
5. Install the project dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Set up the database:
- Ensure you have a compatible database server (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) installed and running.
- Create a new database for the project.
- Update the database configuration in the `settings.py` file located in the `attendance_management_system` directory.
- Apply the database migrations:
  
  python manage.py migrate
  
7. Create a superuser (admin account) for accessing the admin panel:
python manage.py createsuperuser

8. Start the development server:
python manage.py runserver

9. Access the application by visiting `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

## Usage
### Admin Panel
The Attendance Management System provides an admin panel for managing various aspects of the system. To access the admin panel, follow these steps:
1. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000/admin`.
2. Log in using the superuser account created during installation.

### Managing Courses
In the admin panel, you can manage the courses offered by the school. You can add, edit, or delete courses as necessary. Each course represents a subject or field of study available to students.

### Managing Staff
The system allows you to manage staff members who are associated with the school. In the admin panel, you can add, edit, or remove staff members. Each staff member is associated with a user account and a specific role (admin, staff, or student).

### Managing Students
Students can be managed through the admin panel. You can add, edit, or delete student records, along with their associated user accounts. Each student is linked to a course, indicating their area of study.

### Tracking Attendance
The Attendance Management System enables tracking attendance for students. The attendance records are associated with subjects and students. The system allows you to log attendance for individual subjects and generate attendance reports.

### Managing Timetables
Timetables represent the schedule of classes and subject sessions. In the admin panel, you can create, modify, or delete timetables for different courses and subjects.

### Managing Feedback
The system allows students and staff members to provide feedback. Feedback can be managed in the admin panel, where you can view, respond to, or delete feedback entries from students and staff members.

## Customization and Extension
The Attendance Management System is built using Django, a flexible web framework. You can customize and extend the application to suit your specific requirements. Some possible customization and extension options include:

- Modifying existing models or adding new models to capture additional data.
- Adding authentication mechanisms to allow users to register and log in.
- Implementing additional features such as notifications, reports, or analytics.
- Enhancing the user interface by modifying templates or using front-end frameworks.
